###Background
This project is based on [hackerzhou's Love project](http://github.com/hackerzhou/Love).

I've made some modifications to this project to send it as present for my girl's graduation and out four year anniversary.

Before this project, I knowed little about fronted development. What I had modified or added is straightforward, there maybe even some errors. What ever, I consider it as a good try.

U can see it at [project's main page](http://biaobiaoqi.me/Love).

###What's new in this version

* 1.Added background music using [soundmanager2](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/).
* 2.Added waiting process before music is loaded.
* ~~3.Added full screen mode~~ .(some browers do not support.. I don't understand. Some one can help me?)

Welcome to customize it by yourself;)
